## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions for libuipc

[![Docker](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

This fork provides fully automated GitHub Action functionality for libuipc (https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc), delivering the following benefits:

### üîß Reliability in Build

GitHub Actions offer high reliability and transparency during the compilation process. You do not need to carefully read through documentation to figure out which specific libraries need to be installed during the installation process.

### üê≥ Docker Sealed
The original libuipc recommends installing specific versions of GCC compilers and the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit using `conda`.
However, using `conda` can conflict with `pip` if not managed carefully. Encapsulating everything within a Docker container ensures excellent maintainability in this regard.

### üöÄ Simplified Installation Process
Our GitHub Actions rely on `.github/workflows/libuipc-build.sh` to install dependencies without any user intervention. More specifically, installation, compilation, and running an example can be done by simply executing the following commands:

```bash
SCRIPT_PATH=$HOME/libuipc-github-actions/.github/workflows/libuipc-build.sh
bash $SCRIPT_PATH setup    # Install dependencies
bash $SCRIPT_PATH compile  # Compile the library
bash $SCRIPT_PATH run      # Run a test example
```

### üßπ Simplified Cleanup
Since everything is contained within the Docker environment, any traces left over from the installation process can be easily cleaned up.

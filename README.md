## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions for libuipc

[![Docker](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/docker.yml) [![vast-ai](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/vast-ai.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions/actions/workflows/vast-ai.yml)

This fork provides fully automated GitHub Action functionality for libuipc (https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc), delivering the following benefits:

### üîß Reliability in Build

Despite most packages being automatically installed via `vcpkg`, some libraries still need to be manually installed. In contrast, GitHub Actions offer high reliability and transparency during the compilation process without any user intervention, so you do not need to carefully read through documentation to figure out which specific libraries need to be installed.

### üê≥ Docker Sealed

The original libuipc recommends installing specific versions of GCC compilers and the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit using `conda`.
However, using `conda` can conflict with `pip` if not managed carefully. Encapsulating everything within a Docker container ensures excellent maintainability in this regard.
Here's how to run in a Docker container.
You need to install both Docker and the Docker Container Toolkit.

```bash
cd $HOME

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions.git

# set variables
DOCKER_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04
TMP_CONTAINER_NAME=libuipc
TMP_SCRIPT_PATH=/root/libuipc-github-actions/.github/workflows/libuipc-build.sh

# create a container
docker run -d -t --gpus all \
    --name $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME \
    -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility \
    $DOCKER_IMAGE

# copy files
docker cp $HOME/libuipc-github-actions $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME:/root/libuipc-github-actions

# setup, compile and run
docker exec $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME bash $TMP_SCRIPT_PATH /root setup
docker exec $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME bash $TMP_SCRIPT_PATH /root compile
docker exec $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME bash $TMP_SCRIPT_PATH /root run

# cleanup
docker stop $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME
docker rm $TMP_CONTAINER_NAME
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è [vast.ai](https://vast.ai) Support

Our GitHub Actions also support [vast.ai](https://vast.ai) instances. All you need to do is create a template with `nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04`, provision an instance, and run

```bash
cd $HOME

git clone https://github.com/ryichando/libuipc-github-actions.git
SCRIPT_PATH=$HOME/libuipc-github-actions/.github/workflows/libuipc-build.sh

bash $SCRIPT_PATH $HOME setup   # Install dependencies
bash $SCRIPT_PATH $HOME compile # Compile the library
bash $SCRIPT_PATH $HOME run     # Run a test example
```

### üßπ Simplified Cleanup
Since everything is contained within the Docker environment, any traces left over from the installation process can be easily cleaned up.

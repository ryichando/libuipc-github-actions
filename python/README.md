The Pybind for Libuipc ([Website](https://spirimirror.github.io/libuipc-doc/)): 

A Cross-Platform Modern C++20 **Lib**rary of **U**nified **I**ncremental **P**otential **C**ontact.

## Introduction

**Libuipc** is a library that offers a unified **GPU** incremental potential contact framework for simulating the dynamics of rigid bodies, soft bodies, cloth, and threads, and their couplings. It ensures accurate, **penetration-free frictional contact** and is naturally **differentiable**. Libuipc aims to provide robust and efficient **forward** and **backward** simulations, making it easy for users to integrate with machine learning frameworks, inverse dynamics, robotics, and more.

We are **actively** developing Libuipc and will continue to add more features and improve its performance. We welcome any feedback and contributions from the community!

## Why Libuipc

- **Easy & Powerful**: Libuipc offers an intuitive and unified approach to creating and accessing vivid simulation scenes, supporting a variety of objects and constraints that can be easily added.
- **Fast & Robust**: Libuipc is designed to run fully in parallel on the GPU, achieving high performance and enabling large-scale simulations. It features a robust and accurate frictional contact model that effectively handles complex frictional scenarios without penetration.
- **High Flexibility**: Libuipc provides APIs in both Python and C++ and supports both Linux and Windows systems.
- **Fully Differentiable**: Libuipc provides differentiable simulation APIs for backward optimizations.

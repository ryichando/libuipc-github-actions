# Build & Install

A Cross-Platform Modern C++20 **Lib**rary of **U**nified **I**ncremental **P**otential **C**ontact.

This page will guide you through building the project.

We use Vcpkg and PyPI to manage the libraries and use CMake to build the project. 

Vcpkg supports both Windows and Linux, we use it to manage the dependencies and keep the consistency of the development environment.


## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build the project.

| Name                                                | Version      | Usage           | Import         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)                | >=3.26       | build system    | system install |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)         | >=3.10       | build system    | system install |

| [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)         | >=2024.04.26 | package manager | git clone      |


The following are **libuipc**'s 3rd-party dependencies. 

!!!NOTE
    Normally, you don't need to install the following dependencies manually.

| Name                                   | Version | Usage                                               | Import    |

## Automatic Dependency Installation

The Dependencies and submodules will be automatically installed in the CMake Configuration step.

If the automatic installation fails, please raise an issue with the CMake error message.


=== "Windows"

    ## Install Vcpkg
    
    If you haven't installed Vcpkg, you can clone the repository with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```
    The simplest way to let CMake detect Vcpkg is to set the system environment variable `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to `(YOUR_VCPKG_PARENT_FOLDER)/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
    
    ## Build Libuipc
    
    On Windows, you can use the `CMake-GUI` to configure the project and generate the Visual Studio solution file with only a few clicks.
    
    Or, you can use the following commands to build the project.
    
    ```shell
    cd libuipc; cd ..; mkdir CMakeBuild; cd CMakeBuild
    cmake -S ../libuipc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>
    cmake --build .
    ```
    
    ## Run Project
    
    Just run the executable files in `CMakeBuild/<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>/bin` folder.
    
    ## Build Pyuipc
    
    Pyuipc is a Python binding of libuipc. It is built with the `pybind11` library.
    
    Download [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    
    Install packages with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    pip install pybind11 mypy numpy
    ```
    
    We use `mypy.stubgen` to generate the stub files for the Python binding.  The stub files will be generated in the `libuipc/python/typings` folder automatically after building `pyuipc`.
    
    Add `-DUIPC_BUILD_PYBIND=1` to the CMake command to build the Python binding.
    
    NOTE: `pyuipc` should be built in the **Release** or **RelWithDebInfo** mode.
    
    (Optional) If you need torch support, you need to install the torch package first.
    
    ```shell
    pip install torch
    ```
    
    Add `-DUIPC_BUILD_TORCH_EXTENSION=1` to the CMake command to enable the pytorch extension.
    
    ## Install Pyuipc
    
    After building the project, install the Python binding with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    cd libuipc/python; pip install .
    ```
    
    Then you can use the `pyuipc` in your Python environment with:
    
    ```python
    from pyuipc_loader import pyuipc
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ## Install Vcpkg
    
    If you haven't installed Vcpkg, you can clone the repository with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ```
    The simplest way to let CMake detect Vcpkg is to set the system environment variable `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to `(YOUR_VCPKG_PARENT_FOLDER)/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
    
    We recommend using conda environments to build the project on Linux. See the [Conda](#Conda) section for more details. If you don't want to use conda, then go on with the following steps.
    
    ## Build Libuipc
    
    You can use the following commands to build the project.
    
    ```shell
    cd libuipc; cd ..; mkdir CMakeBuild; cd CMakeBuild
    cmake -S ../libuipc -DUIPC_BUILD_GUI=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>
    cmake --build . -j8
    ```
    
    !!!NOTE
        Use multi-thread to speed up the build process as possible, becasue the NVCC compiler will take a lot of time.
    
    To enable GUI support, set `-DUIPC_BUILD_GUI=1`, but you may need to install some additional dependencies manually (system install). See [Linux GUI Support](#gui-support).
    
    ## Run Project
    
    The excutable files are in the `CMakeBuild/<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>/bin` folder. 
    
    To run the programs, you may need to set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the shared libraries in the `CMakeBuild/<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>/bin` folder, otherwise the shared **libuipc** library and the dependent backend modules may not be found.
    
    ```shell
    cd CMakeBuild/<Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo>/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.
    ./hello_uipc
    ./uipc_test_world
    [...]
    ```
    
    ## Build Pyuipc
    
    Pyuipc is a Python binding of libuipc. It is built with the `pybind11` library.
    
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    ```
    
    Install packages with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    pip install pybind11 mypy numpy
    ```
    
    We use `mypy.stubgen` to generate the stub files for the Python binding.  The stub files will be generated in the `libuipc/python/typings` folder automatically after building `pyuipc`.
    
    Add `-DUIPC_BUILD_PYBIND=1` to the CMake command to build the Python binding.
    
    NOTE: `pyuipc` should be built in the **Release** or **RelWithDebInfo** mode.
    
    (Optional) If you need pytorch support, you need to install the pytorch package first.
    
    ```shell
    pip install torch
    ```
    
    Then set `-DUIPC_BUILD_TORCH_EXTENSION=1` to the CMake command to enable the pytorch extension.
    
    ## Install Pyuipc
    
    After building the project, install the Python binding with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    cd libuipc/python; pip install .
    ```
    
    Then you can use the `pyuipc` in your Python environment with:
    
    ```python
    from pyuipc_loader import pyuipc
    ```
    
    ## Conda
    
    If you are using conda, you can create a new environment with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    conda create -n uipc_env python=3.10
    ```
    
    Then activate the environment with:
    
    ```shell
    conda activate uipc_env
    ```
    
    ## CMake
    Install CMake-3.26 with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    conda install cmake=3.26
    ```
    
    ## GCC
    
    Install the tested version of gcc with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    conda install gcc_linux-64=11.2.0 gxx_linux-64=11.2.0
    ```
    
    ## Cuda
    
    Install the tested version of cuda with the following command:
    
    ```shell
    conda install nvidia/label/cuda-12.4.0::cuda-toolkit
    ```
    
    Cuda-12.4.0 requires driver version >= 550.54.14 (https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#use-the-right-compat-package),check your nvidia driver version with the following command
    
    ```shell
    nvidia-smi
    ```
    
    ## Then
    
    Go back to the [Linux](#linux) or [Windows](#windows) build steps to continue building the project.

## Run Examples

Then you can run the examples in the `libuipc/python` folder.

- `uipc_info.py`: print the basic information of the `uipc` library. 
- `tutorial/`: contains the basic usage of `Pyuipc`.

You can run the `uipc_info.py` to check if the `Pyuipc` is installed correctly.

We use [polyscope](https://polyscope.run/)(v2.3.0) to visualize the scene in Python. If you want to run the GUI examples, you need to install the `polyscope` library with the following command:

```shell
pip install polyscope==2.3.0
```

## Build Document

Download and install [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html).

Install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and its plugins:
```shell
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-literate-nav mkdoxy mkdocs-video
```

Turn on the local server:
```shell
mkdocs serve
```

Open the browser and visit the [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## Troubleshooting

=== "Windows"


=== "Linux"

    ### GUI Support 
    
    If your system hasn't installed the GUI application dependencies before, you may need to install the following packages to enable GUI support.
    
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev
    ```
    
    ### Python3 System Requirement
    
    Python3 currently requires the following programs from the system package:
    
    - autoconf
    - automake
    - autoconf-archive
    
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autoconf-archive
    ```

### Submodule Manual Initialization & Update

If the submodule is not initialized, you can use the following command to initialize the submodule:

```shell
git submodule update --init
```
